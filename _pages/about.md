Hannah S. Kenagy (she/her) is an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellow studying atmospheric chemistry at MIT with [Prof. Jesse Kroll](http://krollgroup.mit.edu/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} and [Prof. Colette Heald](https://www.healdgroupmit.com/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}.  Previously, Hannah received a BS in Chemistry from the University of Chicago in 2016 and a PhD in Chemistry with [Prof. Ron Cohen](https://cohen.cchem.berkeley.edu/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} from UC Berkeley in 2021.  Hannah's work uses an integrated combination of measurement and modeling tools to study atmospheric chemical pathways that contribute to the production and fate of air pollutants globally.

During her PhD, Hannah used a combination of airborne field observations and computational modeling techniques to study the chemistry of nitrogen oxides in urban environments, with a particular focus on nighttime and condensed phase chemistry.

As a post-doc, Hannah is integrating modeling and laboratory studies to improve our understanding of atmospheric organic aerosol chemistry.
