Hannah S. Kenagy (she/her) is an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellow studying atmospheric chemistry at MIT with [Prof. Jesse Kroll](http://krollgroup.mit.edu/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} and [Prof. Colette Heald](https://www.healdgroupmit.com/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}.  Previously, Hannah received her BS in Chemistry from the University of Chicago in 2016 and received a PhD in Chemistry with [Prof. Ron Cohen](https://cohen.cchem.berkeley.edu/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} from UC Berkeley in 2021.  Hannah's work uses both measurements and modeling tools to better understand atmospheric oxidation pathways and their impacts on atmospheric particulate matter.


During her PhD, Hannah used airborne field observations and computational modeling techniques to study the chemistry of nitrogen oxides in urban environments, with a particular focus on nighttime and condensed phase chemistry.
